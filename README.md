Heroku Buildpack for Middleman
==============================

For tinkering.

Flow
----

Here's the basic flow of how the buildpack works:

Ruby (Gemfile and Gemfile.lock is detected)

* runs Bundler
* installs binaries
  * installs node if the gem execjs is detected
* runs `rake assets:precompile` if the rake task is detected

Rack (config.ru is detected)

* everything from Ruby
* sets RACK_ENV=production
* builds Middleman

Rails 2/3 detection remains but will be ignored.
